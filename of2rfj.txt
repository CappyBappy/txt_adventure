This will just be for planning my stuff
So we have the player, and they can pick from one of four characters:
1. the magician- high magic attack, very low defense, very low regular attack, has healing ability (can pick to heal), moderate wealth
2. the barbarian- no magic attack, moderate defense, very high regular attack, has berserk ability (one sure kill in game), low wealth
3. the charlatan- moderate magic attack, low defense, moderate regular attack, has smooth tongue ability (choose the right dialogue option and monster goes away), moderate wealth
4. the noble knight- moderate magic attack, very high defense, moderate regular attack, has chivalry ability(can mount horse and run away from one battle), high wealth
They can pick their name and character, and from four weapons (correlating to the characters)
1. The wand- gives magic attack boost
2. The club- gives regular attack boost
3. The poison- allows player to slowly poison one monster to death
4. The sword and shield- gives small boost to regular attack and defense
How I will execute-
Each type of character has their own story
We have the main program that takes in player name and character choice and simply runs programs based on that
four different programs for the characters
one program for attacking monsters
a monster class with multiple types- initially randomly generated but the boss monster is not
Items-
1. Red potion- heals you a bit
2. Black potion- restores you to full health
3. Orange potion- magic attack
4. Green potion- regular attack
5. Pink potion- reduces defense to zero
6. Silver potion- instant kill
7. Gold potion- takes you out of battle
Each character fights like five monsters till boss man
So what programs do I need?
1. Main one that executes the others
2. one for each character type
3. a monster class and a method that generates them randomly
4. Method for battles? Can probaably do that for each character character class
